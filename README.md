# marketing-data-analysis

Marketing they say is the fuel of business. But how do you know if your marketing efforts yield results and if you are getting value for money spent on adverts? You collect marketing data and analyze it.

In this project, I analyzed marketing data collected by the marketing department of a firm to answer some business questions and further understand how each marketing channel is performing. I calculated Return on Ads Spent (ROAS), Average Order Value (AOV), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and Profitability. The dataset spans 2 years, 2017 to 2018.

Some of the insights obtained for the period of 2 years are:

* There was a total of 14 marketing channels
* Website is the marketing channel that generated the highest overall revenue
* The highest amount on ads was spent on Google Shopping
SEO has the highest ROAS
* MobileApp has the highest AOV
* Google shopping has the highest CAC
* MobileApp has the lowest CAC
* A total of 1,378 new customers were brought in from these marketing channels over 2 years.
* These new customers were responsible for $7.15 million dollars (27.52%) of the total revenue for that time period
* The majority of the revenue $18.84 million dollars (72.48%) still came from old customers
* The highest revenue was obtained in November, week 48 in both years. This can be attributed to black Friday sales in November. Likewise, the highest money spent on ads was during this time period.
* MobileApp was responsible for bringing in the lowest number of new customers of just 3 while the highest number of new customers brought in by any channel was 106.


I hope you enjoyed my analysis.
